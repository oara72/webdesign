		<p>This simplified version of the 30 Articles of the <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> has been created especially for young people.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We Are All Born Free & Equal. We are all born free. We all have our own thoughts and ideas. We should all be treated in the same way.</li>
				<li>Don’t Discriminate. These rights belong to everybody, whatever our differences.</li>
				<li>The Right to Life. We all have the right to life, and to live in freedom and safety. </li>
				<li>No Slavery. Nobody has any right to make us a slave. We cannot make anyone our slave. </li>
				<li>No Torture. Nobody has any right to hurt us or to torture us. </li>
				<li>You Have Rights No Matter Where You Go. I am a person just like you! </li>
				<li>We’re All Equal Before the Law. The law is the same for everyone. It must treat us all fairly. </li>
				<li>Your Human Rights Are Protected by Law. We can all ask for the law to help us when we are not treated fairly. </li>
				<li>No Unfair Detainment. Nobody has the right to put us in prison without good reason and keep us there, or to send us away from our country. </li>
				<li>The Right to Trial. If we are put on trial this should be in public. The people who try us should not let anyone tell them what to do. </li>
				<li>We’re Always Innocent Till Proven Guilty. Nobody should be blamed for doing something until it is proven. When people say we did a bad thing we have the right to show it is not true. </li>
				<li>The Right to Privacy. Nobody should try to harm our good name. Nobody has the right to come into our home, open our letters, or bother us or our family without a good reason. </li>
				<li>Freedom to Move. We all have the right to go where we want in our own country and to travel as we wish. </li>
				<li>The Right to Seek a Safe Place to Live. If we are frightened of being badly treated in our own country, we all have the right to run away to another country to be safe. </li>
				<li>Right to a Nationality. We all have the right to belong to a country.</li>
